description = "In this series, I'll setup Cribl Edge to forward data to S3, which I'll host myself with Minio. Then we'll use Tailscale to expose Minio to the Internet and run Cribl Search against that data."

Now that Minio is internet accessible, let's configure Cribl Search to read that data. In Search, there's two concepts that are relevant to our configuration: [Datasets](https://docs.cribl.io/search/datasets) and [Dataset Providers](https://docs.cribl.io/search/datasets#dataset-providers). We will configure a Dataset Provider to access our Minio endpoint on the internet, and a Dataset to query our particular bucket in Minio.

1. Go to Cribl Search
    * From Edge or Search, select the product hamburger at the top and select `Search`
    * From the Cloud main navigation, click `Search`
1. Click `Data`
1. Click `Dataset Providers` at the left
1. Click the `New Dataset Provider` button
1. Under `Dataset Provider Type`, click `Cribl Edge` then select `Amazon S3`
1. Click `Advanced Settings` to expand more options
1. Fill out the form like this:

<p align="center"><img src="../images/dataset_provider.png" /></p>

1. Add an `ID`
1. Set `Access Key` and `Secret Key` to values you setup in Part 1
1. Set `Endpoint` to the `https://` URL you got in Part 3
1. Click `Save`

You now have a `Dataset Provider` which is pointing to your Minio. Next, we need to configure a `Dataset` which uses that provider. 

1. Click `Data`
1. Click `New Dataset` at the right
1. For `ID` enter something that matters to you, you'll be using in search
1. Click `Provider` and select the provider you added before
1. For bucket, enter `data/${_time:%Y}/${_time:%m}/${_time:%d}/${_time:%H}/${host}`
    * If you named your bucket something other than `data` make sure to replace that in this string
1. For region, select `US East 1`
1. Your form should look like this:

<p align="center"><img src="../images/dataset.png" /></p>

We now have a dataset which understands the partitioning structure we created in the S3 output. Now we should be able to search our data. 

1. Click `Search` next to your dataset

You should see a screen that looks like this:

There's lots we can do to explore the data we've been collecting, but that's for another post. [Check out our documentation](https://docs.cribl.io/search/search-101/) for more information on how to craft searches and get value out of your data.

Hope this was helpful and fun! More content coming as I work to explore the data being generated out of my home network.

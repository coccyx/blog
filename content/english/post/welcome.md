# Welcome

It's been two years since I first established this blog with the intention of writing about entrepreneurship. I wrote a few Cribl-related [technical blog posts](/tech), and I've struggled to find the time to put down my thoughts to paper. As Cribl has surpassed $100M in ARR and we've scaled beyond 600 people, my thoughts are turning towards capturing insights from our early journey before they fade even further from my memory. Over the coming months, my hope is to recount some hard learned lessons from our very early days, as well as capturing some key lessons from our early scaling journey.

My hope is this is valuable to entrepreneurs. This has been the most challenging and rewarding experience of my career. I feel very fortunate to have been lucky enough, found the right timing, and been smart enough to capture the opportunity. If you too share the fortune and timing, my hope is to impart a modicum of wisdom to help you avoid the same pitfalls we fell into at Cribl.

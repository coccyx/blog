[In part 6](../5) we got our blog building in our CI/CD pipeline. Now we're going to run that built image in our Raspberry Pi K8S cluster. One of the pieces of infrastructure you get in the cloud is a load balancer. How do we replicate that on bare metal? There's a really awesome project called [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/) that allows us to do this on hardware. MicroK8S provides an add-on for this. On one of the nodes, run:

```shell
microk8s enable metallb:192.168.68.20-192.168.68.39
```

Obviously, substitute an IP range that'll work for your local network configuration. I gave it 20 IPs, but I doubt I'll ever be exposing that many services. You'll want to make sure those IP ranges are outside of your DHCP scopes you don't end up with IP conflicts. 

With MetalLB, any service you create in K8S will get an IP on your LAN and you can treat it like a cloud network load balancer. Your traffic will end up on the inside of your K8S network just like with a cloud load balancer. Now, let's create a Kubernetes service that will take advantage of it. [I have a file in my repo](https://github.com/coccyx/blog/blob/main/deployment/k8s-blog.yml) called `k8s-blog.yml` which has the following contents:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: blog
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: blog
  namespace: blog
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: blog
  annotations:
    {}
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports: 
      - port: 80
        targetPort: 80
        protocol: TCP
        name: web
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: blog
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: blog
  namespace: blog
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: blog
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: blog
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app.kubernetes.io/name: blog
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: blog
          image: clintsharp/blog:latest
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 2000m
              memory: 512Mi
            requests:
              cpu: 100m
              memory: 128Mi
```

I'm assuming you know a bit about Kubernetes if this interested you, so I'll not go through intimate details on what all of this is. We're creating a namespace, a deployment, and a service. After running `kubectl apply -f ./deployment/k8s-blog.yml` and after the deployment finishes converging I'll have a working blog in Kubernetes.

To validate, I ran `kubectl get po -n blog` and I see pods deployed:

```shell
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
blog-5844664449-pbqpw   1/1     Running   0          5d17h
blog-5844664449-627kt   1/1     Running   0          5d17h
blog-5844664449-gdrpl   1/1     Running   1          5d17h
```

When I interrogate the service with `kubectl get svc -n blog` I see the IP assigned from `MetalLB`:

```shell
NAME   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
blog   LoadBalancer   10.152.183.173   192.168.68.20   80:30201/TCP   6d18h
```

I can now see my blog running on my LAN at http://192.168.68.20/. The last thing I want to do is setup the deployment for autoscaling, which I do with `kubectl autoscale deployment blog --cpu-percent=50 --min=3 --max=20`. This will automatically scale up to 20 pods when we see the average CPU usage above 50% for the running pods.

We have a running blog in Kubernetes on bare metal! [Next, we will expose this to the internet and deploy on change](../7).
